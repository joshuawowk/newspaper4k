  "content": "BURRILLVILLE – Boston Police and Fire Departments are partnering with Buckleupallofus on Monday, August 1, reminding kids and families about traffic, and vehicle and child passenger safety during their National Night Out Event. This annual Boston event takes place at Hiratio Harris Park located in the Roxbury section of that city. The big attraction this year will be the giant Buckleupallofus balloon showcase, and the thousands of kids safety fridge magnets, coloring posters and books, crayon packs, tee shirts, posters, stickers and book page savers being passed out by Boston police officers and firefighters. Thousands of inner city kids will be taking home Bucky products and publications, teaching them about vehicle safety. Boston police officers and firefighters will also be distributing Fearless Dino Protector Squad and Itty Bitty SUPER DUPERS safety products and publications reminding kids about fire safety and burn prevention as well as kids, “Be a Buddy, Not a Bully,” campaign items. These kids safety handouts will go beyond this one night event, which takes place from 6 until 8:30 p.m. The items, featuring the very popular, “Seasons Of Safety,” coloring campaign, will be distributed throughout the year at grade schools, daycares, libraries, community centers, family clinics, pediatric doctors offices and events throughout Boston. The executive director of Massachusetts-based Children Across America  received the request to showcase the giant Buckleupallofus balloon, and bring safety products and publications to pass out to all of the kids attending their annual city event, after Boston and Massachusetts State Police officers watched the Bucky balloon attraction during a recent parade. Thousands of children across the city of Boston will be directly impacted by taking home dozens of Bucky, Fearless Dino Protector Squad and Itty Bitty SUPER DUPERS fun, safety and injury prevention products and publications on Monday, August 1, and during the upcoming school year. Color in this Sunday Cartoon featuring Bucky with a couple of his friends, and keep this in the back of your mind: Buckleupallofus is going places, reaching thousands of families, and hoping to save kids lives.
