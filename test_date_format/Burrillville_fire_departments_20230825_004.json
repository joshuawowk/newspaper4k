  "content": "BURRILLVILLE – Burrillville’s fire districts will receive a $955,974 Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Assistance to Firefighters Grant, funding to be used to replace outdated communications equipment, according to a release this week from the state’s federal delegation. The regional initiative will provide state-of-the-art systems for each of Burrillville’s fire apparatus and a new multi-band portable radio for every firefighter in Oakland-Mapleville, Pascoag, Harrisville, and Nasonville. The new radio communication systems are expected to improve emergency response and bolster safety of local firefighters responding to scenes of emergencies across numerous communities. “Upgraded equipment for the town’s four fire districts will significantly improve ability to respond to emergencies and will enhance safety of firefighters by ensuring they can effectively communicate with one another on scene,” noted the release. “This grant will also ensure that the fire districts are in compliance with RISCON and national standards and will allow for more effective collaboration when responding to mutual aid calls.” Pawtucket Fire Departments will receive a $813,795 grant. “Ensuring that our local firefighters are able to communicate with each other while responding to emergencies is an absolutely essential part of keeping them healthy and safe,” said Sen. Jack Reed. “I am pleased to help deliver more than $1.7 million in federal funds for Pawtucket and Burrillville to ensure our firefighters have the state-of-the-art tools they need to stay safe while protecting and serving our neighborhoods.” “In an emergency, a few seconds could mean the difference between life or death, and we must do everything we can to equip RI firefighters with the tools they need to respond to emergencies quickly,” said Rep. Seth Magaziner. “This federal funding for fire departments in Pawtucket and Burrillville will help improve response times and emergency readiness to keep communities safe.”",
