  "content": "GLOCESTER – Fire districts in Glocester are repeating their calls that residents use caution amid dangerous weather conditions after responding to two separate brush fires on Tuesday, Nov. 19. Firefighters were reportedly called to one blaze on Blackington Drive Tuesday afternoon after debris from a wood furnace sparked fire in one resident’s backyard. The fire was quickly extinguished, but was one of multiple incidents of unexpected brush burns across Rhode Island over the past two weeks. Harmony Fire Department noted on Wednesday that a Red Flag Warning – the highest fire alert issued by the National Weather Service – remains in affect in the area, and small outdoor fires can quickly get out of hand. The danger is caused by the combination of warm temperatures, very low humidity, and strong winds. Locals are reminded not to burn anything outside, including leaves and brush, and to discard of smoking materials carefully. Residents should also refrain from having campfires and cooking fires. “Keep your property safe,” the department noted.",
