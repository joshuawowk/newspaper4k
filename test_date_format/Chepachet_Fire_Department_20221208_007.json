  "content": "GLOCESTER – The Chepachet Fire Department is currently auctioning off a 2007 GMC C4500 Horton Ambulan c e, a vehicle that could be converted into the ultimate camper for road trips, according to the auction site. The online auction is open to the public at municibid.com and e nds Wednesday, Dec. 21 . All proceeds from the sale will go to the department to help fund operations such as new water hoses, another vehicle, helmets, and other essentials the fire department needs to fight fires and save the lives, according to a release announcing open bidding. “With the holiday travel & shopping season in full swing, Rhode Islanders are now in the market for road trip vehicle options,” it notes. “ Travel enthusiasts and DIY fanatics would have a blast converting this ambulance into the road trip vessel of their dreams.” The auction began last Wednesday, Dec. 7, and has a $10,000 reserve, which had not been met as of Thursday, Dec. 8. The ambulance has 128,838 miles and features a 6.6 diesel engine, Allison 6-speed automatic transmission, OnSpot Chain System, Stryker MX stretcher and stretcher mounts. The sale includes full maintenance and repair records, along with two extra tires. Reps from the auction space note that upcycling has exploded in popularity over the years, and it is now being seen all over the automotive space. “Creative visionaries are now refurbishing vehicles like ambulances that are no longer being used and repurposing them by giving them a completely new look and life,” noted the release. “The winning bidder can customize the ambulance to their heart’s desire by adding a kitchen area, sleeping area, TV, a meditation space, and more.” Questions about the vehicle can be directed to John Greenhalgh at (401) 575-0231.",
