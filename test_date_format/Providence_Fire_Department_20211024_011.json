  "content": "BURRILLVILLE – The Providence Fire Department has teamed up with the Fearless Dino Protector Squad reaching out to kids about home fire safety and burn prevention with a variety of coloring cartoons available on their official website just in time for the upcoming holiday and winter season. The Fearless Dino Protector Squad are a rambunctious team of dinosaurs that actually feature fire apparatus at the ends of their tails. Much like their cousin, Buckleupallofus, who has a seatbelt for a tail, they have cool firefighting tails to combat their arch enemies. DinoShnozzle has a fire hose tail; DinoLadderus has a ladder tail;  DinoTraumasore has a medical bag tail; and DinoTraxxe has an axe tail and four-wheel drive power dino feet. Their mascot is called “911” and is a DinoPuppy. DinoCheifasaurus takes charge with his fire safety clipboard tail when it comes to fire safety. Their villains are lead by Pyro and his gang of FDPS arch enemies called, Smoke Screen, Ignitor, Fireball, Spitfire and Burnout. They all have specific fire and safety hazards that kids need to avoid in order to stay fire safe and prevent unintended burns and injuries. “Safe Kitchen, Safe You,” home fire safety and burn prevention coloring cartoons are available for parents, teachers, daycare staff, librarians, pediatricians, nurses, firefighters and EMT’s on the Providence Fire Department website absolutely free of charge for anyone that wants to help keep kids safer in their homes, apartments and at family and friends residents over the coming holidays and winter season. Jim Weicherding is a Burrillville resident, and the founder and creator of an award-winning traffic safety effort Seasons of Safety. Weicherding contributes kids’ coloring cartoons, which can be printed and used to help parents discuss safety issues with their children. He has a long list of police officers and firefighters in his family and has worked with law enforcement and firefighters in a creative public safety capacity for more than two decades. Jim was recently appointed to Children Across America as their events and creative director for their child safety programs initiatives and outreach kids safety campaigns nationwide.",
